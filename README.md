# Charity-NGO-Website

A Website for a Charitable Organization  :-

 This project is  not a responsive website  but this is my first HTML & CSS code designed for a charitable organization ( only FRONT-END ) . It aims to raise awareness, encourage donations, and recruit 
       volunteers to support the organization's mission. Built using  'HTML and CSS", the website is clean, user-friendly, and accessible on all devices.

Features:
Mission and Vision Statement: A dedicated section highlighting the organization's goals and values.

Donation Form: A user-friendly form for collecting donation details (design only).

Gallery/Stories of Impact: A visually appealing gallery showcasing the organization's work and success stories.

Volunteer Registration Form: A form for users to express interest in volunteering (design only).

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the website content.

CSS3: For styling and creating a responsive layout.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.

Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.
